# Projects

## I. Post-transcriptional Regulation of RNA {#RNA}

Our group is interested in developing bioinformatics technologies and practicing evidence-based medicine. <br>We utilize high-throughput sequencing technologies, together with machine learning and AI, to understand how genetic information is encoded in the structured DNA and RNA sequences, and how they interact and regulate each other in a biological system. Ultimately, this will help us understand and cure human diseases, know and improve ourselves.

## II. Precision Medicine {#MED}

Our group is interested in developing bioinformatics technologies and practicing evidence-based medicine. <br>We utilize high-throughput sequencing technologies, together with machine learning and AI, to understand how genetic information is encoded in the structured DNA and RNA sequences, and how they interact and regulate each other in a biological system. Ultimately, this will help us understand and cure human diseases, know and improve ourselves.
